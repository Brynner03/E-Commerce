# E-Commerce Website
This is my version of an E-Commerce site. This is a MERN Stack project for Unit 2 at General Assembly.

## What will it consist?
The E-Commerce website will be like a functional E-Commerce website. The only difference will be that there will not be a checkout functionality because this is a project, and adding the full checkout process will 

1. Require a different language that was not spoken about yet in my Cohort.
2. It will result in me actually have to sell products, which I am not doing ( atleast not yet ).

Besides that, it will behave like a fully functional E-Commerce website. It will have  the function to add items to checkout, and discard items from checkout. I'll also try to make it so you can leave reviews, but that will be a bonus for me. So, I will do that once once I complete everything else!
